At the end of the session I was not 100% satisfied with the result on my nose, and I saw almost no difference in my furrows. 1 month after my visit I came back to make the necessary adjustments to fill these gaps. Well I left with my furrows as deep as before because they did not want to touch them and still with my bump on my nose because \"according to them\" the results were satisfactory. So I spent €850 on services that absolutely did not change my problem and even made it worse.

And I realized that my last two sessions had been useless except to force me to take new sessions. So I'm finishing my package of 5 sessions with 3 really useful sessions. I don't know if it's a marketing way to force people to take more sessions. But I've already spent 1400 euros almost for nothing. I would have liked an assessment, an appointment to talk about the problem. In short, I have the choice of doing 3 more sessions but for now I'm going to wait.        a year ago 2023-10-20T06:22:02.609Z  Visited in October 2023          0     2 model='gemma3:1b' created_at='2025-09-16T15:13:44.7734222Z' done=True done_reason='stop' total_duration=16528919000 load_duration=280531100 prompt_eval_count=1017 prompt_eval_duration=11366541500 eval_count=103 eval_duration=4877437300 message=Message(role='assistant', content='```json\\n{\\n  \"issues\": [\\n    {\\n      \"issue\": \"lack of assessment / consultation\",\\n      \"actionable\": \"provide assessment\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"issue\": \"high cost / ineffective treatment\",\\n      \"actionable\": \"review pricing and effectiveness\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"issue\": \"unsuccessful results\",\\n      \"actionable\": \"evaluate treatment effectiveness\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```', thinking=None, images=None, tool_name=None, tool_calls=None) gemma3:1b 2025-09-16T15:13:44.7734222Z        stop lack of assessment / consultation   provide assessment         3.0             0.0\n",
